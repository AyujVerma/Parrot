# Parrot
A literacy wesbite designed for young childeren who are learning how to read and write. We use interactive and engaging books and shows to helps kids enjoy reading on their own. 

Our wesbite has two modes, a reading and a writing section. In the reading section, the user reads a passage and speaks into a mic. Using a speech-to-text API, our program analyzes the user's speech and can provide data on it using our algorithm. In the writing section, the user watches a video (without captions) and types what they hear, once again getting feedback through our algorithm. All this data is stored in a database real time and is displayed on an analytics page.

I (Ayuj) worked on creating the text difference algorithm to determine reading and writing scores, tracking other user data, and creating the analytics page.
